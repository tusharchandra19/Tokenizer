# Tokenizer
This is to get an idea on how to build a tokenizer for LLMs.


This tokenizer mimics the tokenization process used by GPT models, leveraging Byte Pair Encoding to efficiently tokenize text input into sub-word tokens. Tokenizers are essential for language models as they convert text data into numeric format, making it suitable for processing by neural networks.
